# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
  In this analysis we use a random of 2,000 pairs of latitudes and longitudes, in order to retrieve from the weather API the weather for the closest city to each of those coordinates. Then, we asked the user to input the maximum and minimum temperatures and we filtered those cities with that requirement. Furthermore, out of those cities we chose 4 cities within a country and created a route map of a round trip withing those cities.
